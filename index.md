I study the history and literature of Ethiopia & Eritrea.
I'm especially interested in Christian magico-religious traditions, heresy, and liturgy.
I also do DH (digital humanities) stuff, including managing [Ethiopicist.com](https://ethiopicist.com) and some other projects, and I enjoy tutoring students in Gəʿəz language.
